# Road-segmentation--UNET-model
This project aims to locate and segment the road area from an image typically taken from the frontal camera of a vehicle
Road segmentation is an important stage in ADAS system in a vehicle for routing and localization

# Approach
data
choosing the algorithm for the problem
data preperation
Model/algorithm
Framework to be used for model realization
Train the model
Evaluate the model
Issues observed
Performance improvement
